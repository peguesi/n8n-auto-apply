How I Engineered a Viral Loop with $0
A Simple Verification Feature Scaled Wercflow to 20k Users
THE CHALLENGE: $0 marketing budget, so we turned the product into a growth engine. Our “Verify Projects” feature used auto-imported callsheet data to trigger seamless invites through a clever “Unverified Project” prompt.

The Solution — Product-Led Viral Loop:
We turned a basic need—
project verification
—into a seamless growth engine. When users saw an
Unverified Project
badge, clicking “Verify” sent an automated email to their teammates, framed as a simple verification request. But behind the scenes, it acted as a smooth
platform invite
. Once their teammate logged in, both users’ projects were verified—creating a natural, self-reinforcing loop that drove continuous user growth.
📊 The Impact — Growth Engine by Design
By embedding growth directly into the user workflow, the
“Verify Project”
feature transformed a simple action into a seamless viral loop—without feeling like a referral gimmick.
